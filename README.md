📊 Simple & Multiple Linear Regression Project

Welcome to this project! 🎉
This repo contains two basic but very powerful machine learning models:

🔹 Simple Linear Regression (SLR) → Predicts a value using one variable.

🔹 Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) → Predicts a value using two or more variables.

📘 What’s Inside?
🧮 Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

Predicts Y from X

Example: Predicting salary 💰 from years of experience 📅

Visualized with a regression line 📈


🧮 Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Predicts Y from multiple features (X1, X2, X3...)

Example: Predicting house price 🏠 from area, rooms, and location

More accurate for real-world problems ✅
